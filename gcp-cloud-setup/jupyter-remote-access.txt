1/ First step
~$ jupyter notebook --generate-config

Writing default config to: /home/ubuntu/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
Edit /home/ubuntu/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py to include the following at the top:

c = get_config()  # get the config object
c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'  # in-line figure when using Matplotlib
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False  # do not open a browser window by default when using notebooks
c.NotebookApp.token = '' # No token. But, please, please always use jupyter over ssh tunnel

2/ Second step
Set up a tunnel from your local machine to access Jupyter over ssh.
~$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/[private key file] -L [localhost port, e.g. 8889]:localhost:[remove port, e.g. 8888] username@<external ip address of gcp instance>

After login using the command above, on the server, start Jupyter.

~$ jupyter notebook

3/ Finally
Start using Jupyter on local browser
Navigate to http://localhost:8899/ and create a new notebook. 
Verify by importing keras or tensorflow. The remote log will also confirm whether you are using the GPU/Cuda libraries.
